## Everyday “what do I type?” guide

When starting a new dev session (or a new ChatGPT conversation):
bash +npm run entity:verify +
If it passes ✅, you’re safe to accept/apply patches.
If it fails ❌, upload the changed files in chat so patches are built from your current sources, or run npm run entity:snapshot if the changes were intentional.

Right after applying patches to other entities (Employees/Vendors/Assets):
bash +npm run entity:verify +
This confirms Customers UI files still match the protected snapshot.

Only after you intentionally change Customers UI:
bash +npm run entity:snapshot +git add .entity-snapshots.json +git commit -m "refresh Customers UI snapshot" +
This advances the baseline so future verifies compare against the new good state.

*** End Patch
